        <p><strong>Last Updated – <time datetime="2021-08-11">August 11, 2021</time></strong></p>
      </header>
      <p>
        Welcome to the platform (the <strong>"MUSO.AI Platform"</strong>) of MUSO.AI (<strong>"MUSO.AI", "we", "us"</strong> and/or <strong>"our"</strong>). MUSO.AI provides a variety of online services to songwriters, musicians and vendors in the music industry through the MUSO.AI Platform (hereinafter, the <strong>"MUSO.AI Services"</strong>).  
      </p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy describes for you and others how we protect data that you enter into the MUSO.AI Platform to use the MUSO.AI Services.  Among other things, this Privacy policy explains what information we collect (including Personal Data, as defined below), how we use that information, how we share that information, your choices concerning our data practices, and other important information. We consider <strong>“Personal Data”</strong> to be any information that alone or in combination with other information could be used to identify you or other users, and does not include data that you provide for public consumption, such as music credits for which you claim an interest (i.e., which must obviously be made known to others).  This Privacy Policy also does not apply to data provided by third parties whose software integrates with the MUSO.AI Platform (hereinafter, the <strong>“Third Party Services”</strong>), as the use of such data is governed by the third parties’ privacy policies.</p>
      <p>As a customer, you maintain control over your account, including the Personal Data associated with it.  Therefore, if you have questions about specific settings and privacy practices for your account or your employers’ account (i.e., if you are a user of the latter), please contact the person that administers such account.</p>
      <p>Before using the MUSO.AI Services or submitting any Personal Data, please review this Privacy Policy and contact us with any questions. If you do not agree with these terms, do not use the MUSO.AI Services.</p>
      <h2>1. OUR PRIVACY PRINCIPLES</h2>
      <p>Notably, to use the MUSO.AI Services, you must provide us with information about you.  This Privacy Policy explains how we use and what we do with such information. For example, the following apply:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We only use Personal Data (as defined below) for your use of the MUSO.AI Services. In essence, we may act as a “service provider” (where applicable) for data transmitted to us by you and other customers. We use and process Personal Data only in accordance with our Terms of Service (i.e., a separate policy to which you have access), and this Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li>We safeguard the security of your Personal Data as if it were our own. We believe that security certifications are good, but that security by design is better. We bake security into our product features, and protect your data with the same security safeguards that we use to protect our own data.</li>
        <li>We do not sell your Personal Data. We recognize that receiving your Personal Data is vital to providing our MUSO.AI Services.  In our view, the sale of your Personal Data would be a grave violation of trust.  Therefore, we want to make clear that we are not in the business of selling your Personal Data and that we do not intend to be in that business.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
      <p>When you interact with us through the MUSO.AI Platform, we may receive Personal Data and other information about you (<strong>“Other Information”</strong>), as explained below.</p>

Personal Data may vary depending on what you choose to share with us and what MUSO.AI Services that you use, and may include identification information such as your email address, your street address, your telephone number, your credit card or banking account information, demographic information, certain account information (i.e., that you maintain at social media or music-related websites), and preference information.
        </li>
        <li><em>Other Information.</em> We may also collect, generate, and/or receive Other Information about you from the MUSO.AI Services as follows:

            <li><em>Log Data.</em> As with most websites and technology services delivered over the Internet, our servers automatically collect information when you access or use the MUSO.AI Services and record it in log files. Such log files may include the Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of the web page visited before using the MUSO.AI Services, browser type and settings, the date and time MUSO.AI Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, language preferences and cookie data.

            </li>
            <li><em>Location Information.</em> We may receive information from you that helps us approximate your location. We may, for example, use a business address submitted by you, or an IP address received from your browser or device to determine approximate location. We may also collect location information from devices in accordance with the consent process provided by your device.
            </li>
            <li><em>Cookie Information:</em> We use cookies and similar technologies to operate and administer our MUSO.AI Services, as they help us to gather and analyze usage and improve your experience. We may also allow third party service providers to use cookies or similar technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites following your use of the MUSO.AI Services. Cookies can be stored on your computer for different periods of time. Some cookies expire after a certain amount of time, or upon logging out (session cookies), while others survive after your browser is closed until a defined expiration date set in the cookie (as determined by the third party placing it), and help recognize your computer when you open your browser and browse the Internet again (persistent cookies).
            </li>
            <li><em>Additional Information Provided to Us.</em> We also may receive Other Information when submitted to our Platform or in other ways, such as if you participate in a focus group, contest, activity or event, apply for a job, request support, interact with our social media accounts or otherwise communicate with us.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

      <p>b. <em>Links to Other Websites.</em>  This Privacy Policy applies only to the MUSO.AI Services. The MUSO.AI Services may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by MUSO.AI (the "Third Party Platforms"). The information that you share with Third Party Platforms will be governed by the specific privacy policies and terms of service of those Third Party Platforms, and not by this Privacy Policy.

Please contact the Third Party Platforms directly for information on their privacy practices and policies.
      </p>
      <p>c. <em>Security.</em>  We implement commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and organizational measures to protect Personal Data both online and offline from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction and to comply with applicable state and federal privacy and security laws. We also apply the same standards to your data that we apply to our own data. However, despite these efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed to prevent interception or misuse. As a result, we must depend on you to protect your information. You should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via the MUSO.AI Service or e-mail. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to us via the Internet. If you become aware of any breach of security or privacy, please notify us immediately.
      </p>
      <p>d. <em>Data Retention.</em>  We keep Personal Data for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy while we have a business need to do so, or if retention is reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Service, or related agreements with you.  We may also retain Personal Data, for a limited period of time, if requested by law enforcement.
      </p>
      <p>e. <em>Aggregated or Pseudonymized Data.</em> In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of our MUSO.AI Services, we conduct research on our Customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and Other Information provided to us. Such research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregated or pseudonymized basis. This aggregated or pseudonymized information does not identify you. We may share aggregated or pseudonymized data with affiliates and partners for business or research purposes. We may also disclose aggregated or pseudonymized user statistics to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to third parties for other lawful purposes.
      </p>
      <p>f. <em>California Privacy Rights Disclosure.</em>  Pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), we act as a “service provider” with respect to the Personal Data that we receive and process through our MUSO.AI Platform, and conduct our data processing in accordance with our Terms of Service.

        <li>Accountability — The data controller is responsible for being able to demonstrate GDPR compliance with all of these principles.</li>
      </ul>
